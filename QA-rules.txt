QA rules:

> Screen resolution support: Desktop only (> 1366px);

> Browser support:
	- Chrome 57+;
	- Firefox 52+;
	- Edge 16+;

> Accessibility:
	- Each clickable element (button/link) should be reachable with the tab keyboard and have style:
	outline: 4px dashed #f89e4b

> Component props:
	- Check component props, see if it works and try to see if component works without props or try to give it wrong prop type(e.g. number instead of string).

> Check z-index:
	- Some elements may hide under others, escpecially when we will add svg elements (mainly particles), most of the times this will be invisible.
	Bugs occur when particles are over some kind of component and you can't interact with interactable components such as buttons and
	you won't be able to mark text (pesticide browser extension recommended).
